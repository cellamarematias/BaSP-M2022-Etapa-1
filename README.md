## About the code
Good practices applied this project:
* Used only one  h1 element for one code sheet.
* Did not skip heading levels in HTML.
* Did not use divs to create headers and footers.
* Did not use HTML to apply styles
## Week 02
---
This week was dedicated to HTML. I created the files and all the elements to start the project. I focused on the semantic and the sintax of the code. During this week I applied good practices to the code achieving a perfect basic  structure to work for the rest of the project.
## Week 03
---
The style's week. I worked on the CSS file to make it as similar as possible to the final "landing page" of the project. It´s important to clear out that I couldn´t use some model desing tools like Flexbox and CSS Grid Layout. So I decided to work with "position" and fix the elements manually to the final position on the screen. The final result is not a responsive design yet.
## Week 04
---
The responsive design's week. This week with the responsive design. This is an approach to web design that aims to make web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes from minimum to maximum display size to ensure usability and satisfaction. I designed a desktop landing, a tablet one and a mobile in the same file.
## Week 05
---
The JavaScript's week. This week we made exercises applying new concepts in this language. Concepts like variables, operators, string, arrays, If, for, functions and so on. With logical reasoning we were able to handle this week's tasks. Also, we fixed some bugs in the responsive behaviour of the last week index.html.
